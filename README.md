# Gift Idea Generator üéÅ

## Author

## Description
The Gift Idea Generator is a simple and interactive web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to select an occasion and age group, then fetches and displays personalized gift ideas based on those inputs. Users can save their favorite gift suggestions and toggle between light and dark mode.

This app fetches data from a local `json-server`, using asynchronous `fetch()` calls and renders content dynamically with DOM manipulation.

## Features
- Select occasion and age group to get tailored gift ideas
- Save your favorite gift suggestions
- Clear saved list
- Responsive UI with Dark Mode toggle
- Runs entirely on a single page with no redirects
- Uses `json-server` to mock backend API
